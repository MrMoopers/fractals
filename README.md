# Fractal-Factory

Projects:
- FractalVB was inspired from a project my Computer Science teacher developed here: http://www.multiwingspan.co.uk/csw.php?page=frac3
- FractalCS was an extention to the previous built using C# which I had started learning in my last year at TBSHS. This project features the most extensive user control and options built in.
- Fractal Factory (CS WPF) was a further extention in which I experimented with the time delay using doubles or decimals caused. It was also found that one allowed further zooming. Using Big Integers would be the way to further develop this project.
- Fractal Factory (CS WPF Multithreaded) was another extention in which I applied multithreading to the project and outputted the 4 cores updates simultaneously.
